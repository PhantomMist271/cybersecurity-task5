# Task 5: Packet Capture and Protocol Analysis

## 🔧 Tool Used:
- Wireshark

## 📦 Protocols Identified:
1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
   - Used when visiting any website (e.g., google.com).

2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
   - Ensures reliable communication.
   - Observed during HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

3. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**
   - Used to transfer web pages from server to browser.
   - Captured while browsing sites during the session.

## 📝 Observations:
- DNS queries were initiated before accessing each website.
- TCP connections showed three-way handshake patterns.
- HTTP requests revealed GET and POST methods with visible headers.
